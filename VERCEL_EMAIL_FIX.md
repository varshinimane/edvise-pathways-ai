# Fix Email Verification Redirect for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
After users click the email verification link, they get "refused to connect" error instead of being redirected to the home page.

## Root Cause
The email verification redirect URL is not properly configured for your Vercel production environment.

## Solution

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variable in Vercel

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Navigate to your project dashboard

2. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add a new environment variable:
     ```
     Key: VITE_SITE_URL
     Value: https://your-app-name.vercel.app
     ```
   - Replace `your-app-name.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel domain
   - Set it for **Production** environment

3. **Redeploy Your Application**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Redirect URLs (Important!)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Open your project

2. **Update Site URL**
   - Go to Settings â†’ General
   - Set **Site URL** to: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

3. **Add Redirect URLs**
   - Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
   - Add these redirect URLs:
     ```
     https://your-app-name.vercel.app/**
     http://localhost:8080/**
     ```
   - The localhost URL is for development
   - The vercel URL is for production

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. **Deploy and Test**
   - Register a new user on your Vercel deployment
   - Check email and click verification link
   - Should now redirect to your Vercel home page

2. **Debug if Still Not Working**
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify the environment variable is set correctly in Vercel
   - Check Supabase auth logs for redirect attempts

## Alternative: Quick Manual Fix

If you know your Vercel domain, you can also update the `.env` file:

```bash
# In your .env file, change:
VITE_SITE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

# To your actual Vercel domain:
VITE_SITE_URL="https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app"
```

Then commit and push the changes.

## How the Fix Works

The updated code now:

1. **Checks for `VITE_SITE_URL` environment variable first** (most reliable)
2. **Auto-detects Vercel environment** using `VITE_VERCEL_URL`
3. **Falls back to current origin** if neither is available
4. **Provides detailed logging** for debugging

## Environment Variables Reference

```bash
# For Development (localhost)
VITE_SITE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

# For Production (your Vercel domain)
VITE_SITE_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"
```

## Verification Steps

After implementing the fix:

1. âœ… Environment variable set in Vercel
2. âœ… Supabase Site URL updated
3. âœ… Supabase redirect URLs added
4. âœ… Application redeployed
5. âœ… Email verification redirects correctly

Your email verification should now work perfectly in both development and production! ðŸŽ‰
